# KarChain

Sample project to keep car data in a blockchain.

### How it works

Any data generated by a car (let's call it X) could be translated to a block. This block has some fields: 
  - index (position);
  - hash (previous block hash + X's name + X's data)
  - previousHash (previous block hash)
  - timestamp (time it was created)
  - name (license plate)
  - data (any data, like current speed)

For every new block generated a new blockchain will be created, with his last data (blocks) plus the new block.
  
### Implementation

Current implementation uses Kotlin and is heavily based on functional programming concepts.
